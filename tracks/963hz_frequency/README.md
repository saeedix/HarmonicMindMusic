## Development Steps
1. **Sound Design**: Use synthesizers or real instruments to generate a pure 963Hz sine wave as the base.
2. **Layering**: Add ambient textures, pads, or nature sounds to enrich the listening experience.
3. **Binaural Beats (Optional)**: Consider adding binaural beats for deeper meditation effects.
4. **Mixing**: Ensure all elements are balanced and the 963Hz tone remains prominent.
5. **Mastering**: Apply gentle mastering to preserve dynamics and clarity.
