## Development Steps
1. **Frequency Selection**: Choose base frequencies and beat frequency (difference between left and right channels).
2. **Sound Design**: Use pure tones or gentle synths for the binaural effect.
3. **Layering**: Add ambient sounds or music for depth.
4. **Mixing**: Ensure the binaural effect is clear and not masked.
5. **Mastering**: Finalize for a balanced, immersive experience.
